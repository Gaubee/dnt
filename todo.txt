- tests for `build`
- Handle deno-types when it specifies a declaration for a `.ts` file (maybe transform the .ts file to .js?)
- Handle dynamic imports (at least ones that are statically analyzable and maybe warn on others)
- Support lockfile
- Special handling of a remote module that is only an `import type ... from "...";` or `export type` (only get declarations).
- specifier mappings for dev dependencies

Notes from Kitson:

- We might need to deal with the types in the tsconfig.json
- How do we handle data URLs and blob dynamic imports?
  - David: We could probably output data URLs to a file.
  - David: Blob dynamic imports... I'm not sure. Dynamic imports will be a problem if they're not statically analyzable, but we can warn the user about that when it happens.
