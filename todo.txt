- tests for `build`
- tests for multiple deno-types for the same module pointing at different .d.ts files (error)
- Handle deno-types when it references a `.ts` file (maybe transform the .ts file to .js?)
- Support multiple entrypoints with a default entrypoint used in package.json (the first one)
- Handle dynamic imports (at least ones that are statically analyzable and maybe warn on others)
- Support lockfile
- Special handling of a remote module that is only an `import type ... from "...";` or `export type` (only get declarations).

Notes from Kitson:

- We would need to rewrite triple slash references
- We might need to deal with the types in the tsconfig.json
- How do we handle remote URLs, data URLs and blob dynamic imports?
  - David: Just changed it to download everything for now, but in the future we can implement remote URL -> bare specifier mapping. Ideally this will be automatic, but in some cases the user will need to specify a bare specifier to use.
  - David: We could probably output data URLs to a file.
  - David: Blob dynamic imports... I'm not sure. Dynamic imports will be a problem if they're not statically analyzable, but we can warn the user about that when it happens.
